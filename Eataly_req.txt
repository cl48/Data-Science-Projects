The non-standard python module I used was Pandas.  This package is required for me to extrapolate json files into a format that would be easiest to summarize (group by and sum) and to put as a dataframe or table layout.  Using pandas is much more straightforward than using a Python standard module such as collections and also pandas performs more efficiently with nested structures.
